In Python this this is just a list. We need K tuples. One for the \n","  index for which list among the list of lists the element lives;  one for the element \n","  index which is where the element lives; and the value of the element. Since we want \n","  the key of the heap to be based on the value of the element, we should put that first\n","  in the tuple.\n","\n","5.While the heap is not empty we need to:\n","  >>Extract the minimum element from the heap: (value, list index, element index)\n","  >>If the element index is not at the last index, add the next tuple in the list index.\n","  \n","### Write the actual code. Ideally, at this point,it should be clear how the code should \n","look like. Here's one example:\n","\n","    def merge(lists):\n","        merged_list = []\n","\n","        heap = [(lst[0], i, 0) for i, lst in enumerate(lists) if lst]\n","        heapq.heapify(heap)\n","\n","        while heap:\n","            val, list_ind, element_ind = heapq.heappop(heap)\n","\n","            merged_list.append(val)\n","\n","            if element_ind + 1 < len(lists[list_ind]):\n","                next_tuple = (lists[list_ind][element_ind + 1],\n","                              list_ind,\n","                              element_ind + 1)\n","                heapq.heappush(heap, next_tuple)\n","                \n","        return merged_list\n","        \n","    \n","    \n","Think of test cases and run them through your interviewer.
